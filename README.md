# C++ Basics and Object-Oriented Programming Mastery Roadmap

This roadmap is designed for beginners to C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It systematically covers the foundational syntax of C++, progresses through essential data structures and memory management, and culminates in a deep dive into OOP principles. The journey concludes with a practical capstone project, allowing you to apply all learned concepts in a real-world scenario and solidify your understanding.

## Requirements
- Understand C++ fundamental syntax and programming constructs.
- Grasp core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
- Develop problem-solving skills using C++.
- Implement small applications demonstrating C++ and OOP principles.

## Tech Stack
- C++ (C++17/C++20 recommended)
- Any C++ compliant compiler (e.g., g++ for GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like VS Code, Visual Studio, or CLion

## Acceptance Criteria
- The program successfully compiles and runs without errors.
- A `Product` class is defined with private attributes (e.g., ID, Name, Price, Quantity) and public methods to access/modify them (getters/setters).
- An `InventoryManager` class is implemented to manage a collection of `Product` objects (e.g., using `std::vector<Product>` or `std::map<int, Product>`).
- The `InventoryManager` supports adding new products, displaying all products, updating product details (e.g., quantity or price), and deleting products.
- The `InventoryManager` includes a search functionality to find products by ID or name.
- Basic error handling is present (e.g., preventing adding products with duplicate IDs, handling invalid input for quantity/price).
- The program uses object-oriented principles such as encapsulation (private data, public methods) and demonstrates proper use of constructors and destructors.
- User interaction is handled via a clear and intuitive console-based menu.
- Proper memory management is observed; if dynamic memory is used, it must be deallocated correctly (e.g., using smart pointers).

## Structure
Each phase of this roadmap exists as a separate Git branch (phase-1, phase-2, etc.) to keep focus on specific milestones. Each phase branch contains a README.md with phase details and milestone tasks.
